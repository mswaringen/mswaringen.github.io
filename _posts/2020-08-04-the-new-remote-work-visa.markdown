You are welcome with open arms as a tourist to a foreign country. All smiles, happy to see you and your money and willing to show you the best parts of their country. Want to stay more than 1-3 months? Those smiles turn to frowns, citizens start to question your intentions; primarily, where is your job? Are you going to try to take a job from a local? Because when the foreign money stops so does the fun.



But fear not foreign traveler or quizzical local, the times are changing. Work from home (WFH) is now a thing. Numerous employer/employee surveys have been released since the COVID era began, but the most telling is Google's recent decree that their global work force will not be required to be back in the office until July 2021, a full 12 months of WFH. The cat is out of the bag: work-from-home-works.



What does this mean for local communities and other tourist hot spots? With WFH compounding on the already going digital nomad movement its easy to imagine the slow-travel-work movement picking up steam. 



Imagine for a minute that you are a Googler who just heard the WFH announcement. You live in San Francisco with 5 of your closest friends but your lease is up for renewal next month. You do some quick research and realize you can work from a beach house for a fraction of your current living costs with a big improvement in quality of life. Maybe the beach life is not a permanent change you want to make, but 6 months could make sense when you have the opportunity, right?



The only obstacle in your way is... the law. Sure you can hope down to the Caribbean or venture to South East Asia without a visa but what happens after that visa-free month runs out? 



This is actually an opportunity to be grabbed by local jurisdictions. Tourism is already down due to COVID, assuming some return to normalcy this is a great time to re-orient your region to medium-term tourism.  Here's why:



1) **Foreign money is even better when its recurring** - The Googler spending 6 months in Bali is renting a villa, paying for food, renting a motorbike, getting surf lessons, and buying local goods. But this isn't a 5 day trip, its continual over 6 months. 



2) **The region just gained a new job** -  The Googler isn't taking a job from a local, she is working a job that used to exist in SF before WFH. This foreign spending is more stable and less prone to the whims of the tourist market. 



3) **Living is more sustainable than tourism** - Its also more sustainable as the Googler is actually living instead of maximizing consumption over a multi-day stretch. Think less kitcschy bus tours and more meaningful local experiences.



How can regions capitalize on this? Start by implementing medium-term remote work visas. Simply showing a legitimate employment agreement and/or bank statements with more than sufficient funds should be enough to prove these individuals will be a net benefit to the economy.



Right now the table is open for the first region(s) to implement such a policy and make a name for themselves in this new tourism movement.
